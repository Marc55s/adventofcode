# Advent of Code
This repository contains my private soultions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
The input to the solutions are not included in this repository, since they shouldn't be shared.

## Rust
Per year directory
The input structure is as follows:  
puzzles/ contains the number of the day as a file
examples/ contains another directory with the day as name like 1/ and more examples with file names like 1.STRING_TOKEN.
To run the whole project use:

```bash
cargo run --bin YEAR or DAY # DAY is not supported yet, for multiple years (cargo workspaces needed)
```
